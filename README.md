On the whole this assignment went well.
I was able to swap out the div tags with header tags that were right below the opening body tag. 
I fixed the broken link. 
I added alt tags to all of the images.
I simplified the Benefit css as much as I could. 
The css for the other classes with duplicate specifications I could not simplify without breaking the site.
Areas for future development take another look at simplifying the css more. 
Become more fluent with semantic tags and replace those div tags.
